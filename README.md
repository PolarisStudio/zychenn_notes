# Notes

10.1 - 10.7 [note_1](https://github.com/PolarisStudio/zychenn_notes/blob/master/Note_1.md)  
The focus is on *Markdown*, *Git* and *Flask*

10.7 - 10.13 [note_2](https://github.com/PolarisStudio/zychenn_notes/blob/master/Note_2.md)  
The focus is on the structure of the Polarishub. Some python packages have been studied, but a lot more still remains unclear for me.
